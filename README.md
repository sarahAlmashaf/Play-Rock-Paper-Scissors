# Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project rocks! ... except when it papers or scissors, that is.  In this project, you'll apply your Python and 
object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. You'll build classes that
represent the game and its players. You'll write computer players that follow various different strategies, as well as a human 
player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.
